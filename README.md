<h4 align="center">Concept</h4>
For years, many states have been increasing their voter restrictions. While these states usually claim that these measures increase election security, many groups have pointed out that they disproportionately affect people of color.
<br />
<br />
That's where this project comes in. I created a web app with two maps. One map displays the voter turnout of different demographics (e.g. turnout of African Americans, turnout of people aged 18-24, etc.) for each state. The other map displays various voting policy fairness scores from the Movement Advancement Project (e.g. ease of voting by mail score, representation & participation score, etc.) for each state. 
<br />
<br />
By configuring the different toggles and comparing the maps, users can reach important conclusions about how certain voting policies impact the turnout of different demographics.
